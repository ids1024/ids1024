Working at [System76](https://github.com/system76) developing [Pop!_OS](https://github.com/pop-os).

Rust is generally my language of choice (at least for certain things), but it can also be fun to try different things. (Sure, might as well write that in a combination of Haskell and Awk!)

Graduated UC Davis 2020, B.S. Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Latin. Because of course.
